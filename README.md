# wave_nn_3d
3d implementation of https://github.com/PerrySquared/wave_nn
marginally worse than the 2d version, best model generated only 40% of paths without any breaks in them, 
although the runtime was lowered more than 10x

can be used alongise a deterministic algorithm, but such impact on runtime should outweigh any gain by the model
